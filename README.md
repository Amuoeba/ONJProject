## Semantic Relation Extraction and Classification in Scientific Papers

### Preface
I have selected a 2018 SemEval task on _"Semantic Relation Extraction and Classification in Scientific Papers"_ as a topic for my assignment. I have decided for this challenge because it greatly coincides with an idea which I have been brewing for quite some time, namely an intellegent sistem that is capable to suggest to scientists which future research steps are more promissing.

I graduated in the field of Biochemistry and towards the end of my studies I realised that biological (probably other too) sciences have a bit of a problem regarding the quantity and frequency of data production and its integration in to overall bio knowledge. Anotother problem arising from quantity of data and its relational complexity is that scientist working in the field usually can't follow rapid data generation and new discoveries wich might be corelated to their research. This leads to formation of _"knowledge bubles"_ which have no media for interaction. I see a solution in a highly capable AI with human-like generalization abilities. This task is a great starting point towards a more complex solution.
